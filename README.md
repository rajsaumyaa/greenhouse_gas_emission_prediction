# 🌍 Greenhouse Gas Emission Prediction

This project focuses on **predicting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions** related to U.S. industry supply chains using **machine learning**. By leveraging publicly available datasets from authoritative government sources, this project provides data-driven insights to help stakeholders understand and potentially reduce emissions.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze historical greenhouse gas emission data
- Clean and preprocess raw datasets
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize emission trends by year, type, and level
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict future emissions
- Interpret results and generate insights for sustainability
